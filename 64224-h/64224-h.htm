  <h2 class='c005'>The Management of Small States Which are Unable to Manage Themselves</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>In the issue of The Outlook for June 18
there was a quotation from a letter of an
Anti-Imperialist correspondent, who, in
speaking of Egypt and the Philippines, stated
that the proper course to pursue was to protect
countries of this nature by international
agreement, the writer citing in support of his
theory the way in which many small powers
had their territories guaranteed by international
agreement.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trouble is in the confusion of ideas
which results in trying to apply the same principle
to two totally different classes of cases.
A State like Switzerland or Holland differs
only in size from the greatest of civilized
nations, and in everything except size stands
at least on a level with them. Such a State
is absolutely competent to preserve order
within its own bounds, to execute substantial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>justice, and to secure the rights of foreigners.
All that is necessary, therefore, is to guarantee
it against aggression; and when the great
Powers have thus guaranteed it, all covenanting
to protect it from the aggression of any
one of their own number, their duty is done
and the needs of the situation completely met.
In such a State the people themselves guarantee
stability, order, liberty, and protection for
the rights of others. There is not the slightest
need of interfering with them, of seeking
to develop them, of protecting them from
themselves. The needs of civilization and
humanity are sufficiently met by protecting
them from outside aggression.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no analogy at all with what occurs
in a community unable to keep elementary
order, or to secure elementary justice within
its own borders, and unable or unwilling to
do justice to foreign nations. The very worst
thing from the standpoint of humanity which
can happen to such a community may be to
guarantee it against outside aggression. The
condition of Algeria under French rule is infinitely
better than its condition before the
French came to Algeria, or than the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of Morocco at this moment. The condition
of Turkestan under Russia has very greatly
improved. The condition of the Sudan at
present, as compared with the condition of
the Sudan under Mahdist rule, is the most
striking example of all. In the same way,
Panama has benefited immeasurably from
every standpoint by the presence of Americans
on the Isthmus. Any arrangement which
had guaranteed Algeria against the French,
or Turkestan against the Russians, or the
Sudan against the English, or Panama against
the Americans, would have been an arrangement
against the interests of humanity and
civilization, and against the interests of the
natives of the countries themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, if there must be interference
for the sake of the country itself, to promote
its growth in order and civilization, actual
experience has shown that such interference
can only come efficiently by one nation, and
not by many. Untried theorists, or even
practical men who are influenced by national
jealousy and are untaught by the lessons of
history, have a curious fondness for trying a
system of joint interference or joint control.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Americans forget, for instance, that we have
actually tried this system and found it completely
wanting, in the case of Samoa. We
made an arrangement with England and
Germany by which there was a joint protectorate
over Samoa. The system worked
wretchedly. It resulted badly for the natives;
it was a fruitful source of bickering among
the three Powers. Then we abandoned the
system, each Power took its own sphere, and
since then we have gotten along admirably;
the only trouble in connection with Samoa
which arose during my entire administration
as President came because we were not able to
grant the earnest request of the natives that
we should take real and complete possession
of our part of the islands and really regulate
the government instead of leaving it so much
in the hands of the native chiefs.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the case of the Philippines, there were
just two things that we could do which would
have been worse than leaving them under
Spanish rule. One of these would have been
to turn the islands adrift to manage themselves.
The second would have been to try
to manage them by a joint arrangement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>various Powers. Any such arrangement in
the case of as rich and valuable islands as the
Philippines would very possibly have led to
war between the great Powers. It would
have certainly led to jealousy, bickerings, and
intrigue among them, would have held the
islands back, would have prevented any development
along the lines of progress and civilization,
and would have insured an endless
succession of devastating little civil wars.</p>

<p class='c010'>When all that is necessary as regards a
small State is to protect it from external
aggression, then the great Powers can with
advantage join to guarantee its integrity.
When anything more is necessary to try to
develop the people and civilization, to put
down disorder, to stop civil war and secure
justice, then a combination of Powers offers
the worst possible way of securing the object
sought to be achieved. Indeed, under such
circumstances it is probably better for the
State concerned to be under the control of a
single Power, even though this Power has
not high ideals, rather than under the control
of three or four Powers which may possess
high ideals but which are put into such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>impossible situation that they are certain to
be riven asunder by jealousy, distrust, and
intrigue, and to do damage rather than good
to the people whom they are supposed to
protect.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A Remedy for Some Forms of Selfish Legislation</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The August number of the “World’s
Work” contains an article which is
of interest to all who are concerned
in the vital subject to which we give the somewhat
foggy title of “Political Reform.” The
article, for obvious reasons anonymous, is
written by a member of Congress who, the
editors of the “World’s Work” say, has
served for more than ten years in the House
of Representatives, has acted on many important
committees, and has been successful
in “getting things” for his constituency. The
article is described as “showing the reason
why the ‘pork-barrel,’ special tariff favors,
and private pension bills become law,” the
reason being, to quote the words of the
author, that “the dictum of the constituency to
the Congressmen is, ‘Get all you can for US.’
There are no restrictions placed upon his
method of getting it.... Until the American
people themselves become more National
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and less local, until constituencies cease to
regard their Congressmen as solicitors at the
National Treasury, Congress will continue to
enact iniquitous groups of local favors into
National legislation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This serious charge against the American
people—for which there is unquestionably
altogether too much justification—the author
proceeds to substantiate by relating some of
his own experiences with constituents which,
however surprising they may seem to the
general reader, will seem almost commonplace
to all who know how the average American
constituency does in actual practice treat its
Congressman.</p>

<p class='c010'>The writer sets forth the fact that, in the
first place, ninety per cent of the letters which
a Congressman receives are requests for
special favors to be obtained in some way or
other, directly or indirectly, from the United
States Treasury. For instance, while the
Payne-Aldrich Tariff Law was under discussion,
this particular Congressman received in
May, 1909, the following letter from the
secretary of a powerful commercial association
in his district:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>I have been instructed by the board of directors of this
association to advise you that at special meeting May 20, a
resolution, copy of which is enclosed, was unanimously
adopted, urging our Representatives in Congress to use every
endeavor to have the present tariff on [mentioning three of
the products of the industries referred to] increased one cent
per pound and the present tariff on [mentioning the other
two products] increased half a cent per pound. I wish to
further advise you that we have heard from Senator ——
and he informs us that he will take care of this matter in the
Senate.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the bill was finally passed, the
Congressman succeeded in adding half a
cent a pound to the duty on two of these
products and in preventing any reduction on
the others. A year later, when the popular
clamor against the bill had become acute, the
same association that had asked him to vote
for increases wrote to the Congressman
denouncing the bill as “the most iniquitous
measure ever enacted by Congress” and
requesting him to explain by letter why he
had voted with “the Reactionaries” to pass
the bill. When it was pointed out to the
association that it had urged the Congressman
to obtain an increase of duty on the products
in which it was interested, it dropped its
demand for an explanation. An influential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>newspaper published in his district editorially
commended him while the bill was under
debate for his “intelligent efforts” to increase
the duty on manufactured articles in which the
district was interested, and a year later the
same newspaper in the same editorial column
denounced him as one of “the legislative
banditti responsible for the Payne-Aldrich
measure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As with the tariff, so with pensions; the
Congressman is urged to obtain local favors
without regard to National interests. This
is illustrated by the following letter, which
the author prints, and which was written by
the clergyman of a large and wealthy church:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>My dear Congressman</i>: I received a call from James H.
—— several days ago, and he told me that he had received a
very unsatisfactory letter from you regarding his chances for
getting a pension. Now, Congressman, while I know he
deserted during the second year of the war, yet there must be
some way the matter can be covered up and —— be given a
pensionable status. He is at present a charge on my congregation.
Every one seems to be able to get a pension. Why
not he? Do what you can for him, and oblige.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be said that this is a unique instance
from which it is unfair to draw a general
inference. The confessing Congressman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>answers, No; that he has “hundreds of such
letters filed away. So has every other Congressman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>River and harbor legislation is another field
in which local selfishness busies itself, to the
exclusion of National needs. In this case
requests are not made by letter but by delegations
which come to Washington besieging
their Senators and Representatives. “There
is,” says the frank writer of this article, “figuratively
speaking, between $50,000,000 and
$60,000,000 on the table to be divided. The
Committee divides it so that every one is satisfied,
at least to a reasonable extent.” Every
one, that is, but the people at large, the people
who have no special interest to serve, and who
feel keenly indignant that the rivers and
harbors of the United States are developed in
a fashion so inferior to that of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor are all the requests for legislation
merely. One constituent desired to have this
particular Congressman put his name on the
free mailing list for all public documents.
That this would be impossible, because it
would mean delivering to the applicant several
tons of documents every month, does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>in the slightest detract from the interest of the
fact elicited by an investigation that the applicant
was the manufacturer of an article made
from waste paper, and the public documents
would afford a useful source of raw material.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is there a remedy for such a state of
things? The answer is, yes; and, moreover,
it is a remedy which Congress can itself
immediately provide.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no complete remedy, of course.
No scheme can be devised which can prevent
such a request as that of the constituent last
named who wished public documents to use in
his private paper business. Requests like this
merely mean that in every district individuals
will always be found who will request improper
favors. As regards these people, all
that can be done is to create a vigorous public
opinion—an opinion which shall not only
make it uncomfortable for any man to demand
such favors, but which shall cordially support
the Congressman in refusing them and hold
him accountable for granting them. We
must trust to individual integrity to resist
such individual and sporadic attempts to corrupt
it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The case is entirely different when we come
to the other favors mentioned. These favors
are those which the Congressman describes as
being improperly, habitually, and insistently
demanded by large portions of a given constituency,
with at least the acquiescence of the
constituency as a whole. It is futile to expect
to cure this type of evil merely by solemnly
saying that each Congressman ought to be
good. It is futile to ask the average Congressman
to cut his own throat by disregarding
the requests of his own constituents for
special and improper favors in the matter of
tariff legislation, river and harbor legislation,
and pension legislation; even though these
same constituents adopt the beautifully illogical
position of expressing a great—and,
curiously enough, often a sincere—indignation
that their Congressman, as the only means of
securing for them what they insist he shall
secure, joins with other Congressmen in granting
for all other constituencies the same improper
favors which are eagerly demanded
by his own individual constituency. Moreover,
under the present system, the small man,
when he asks for something in which his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>district is keenly interested, is told by the big
man who represents the big interest that he
can’t have his little favor granted unless he
agrees to stand by those who wish to grant
the big favor—and the small man may be
remorselessly “held up” in this fashion, even
though the small favor he asks is proper, and
the big favor he is required to grant entirely
improper. When such is the pressure upon
the average Representative, there is certain to
be more or less yielding on his part, in the
great majority of cases. It is idle to hope
that reform will come through mere denunciation
of the average Congressman, or by merely
beseeching him to reach the height of courage,
wisdom, and disinterestedness achieved only
by the exceptional man; by the man who is so
brave and far-seeing and high-minded that
he really will think only of the interests of
the country as a whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, it is just as idle for
Congressmen to seek to excuse themselves as
a body by uttering jeremiads as to the improper
way in which their constituents press
them to do things that ought not to be done.
The individual Congressman can be excused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>only by frankly admitting that the fault lies
with the Congressmen taken collectively. The
remedy is simple and easy of application.</p>

<p class='c010'>Congress has now, and has long had, the
power to rid its members of almost all the
improper pressure brought to bear upon the
individual by special interests—great and
small, local and metropolitan—on such subjects
as tariff legislation, river and harbor
legislation, and pension legislation. Congress
has not exercised this power, chiefly because
of what I am bound to regard as a very shortsighted
and unwise belief that it is beneath
its dignity to delegate any of its functions.
By passing a rule which would forbid the
reception or passage of any pension bill
save the pension legislation recommended by
the Commissioner of Pensions (this of
course to be rejected or amended as Congress
saw fit, but not so amended as to include any
special or private legislation), Congress
would at once do away with the possibility of
its members being subject to local pressure
for improper private pension bills, and at the
same time guarantee proper treatment for the
veteran who really does deserve to have everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>done for him that the country can afford.
The veteran of this stamp has no
stancher friend than the Commissioner of
Pensions; whereas he is often the very man
passed over when special bills are introduced,
because the less deserving men are at least as
apt as the others to have political influence.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the case of the tariff and the river and
harbor legislation, what is needed in each case
is ample provision for a commission of the
highest possible grade, composed of men who
thoroughly know the subject, and who possess
every attribute required for the performance
of the great and difficult task of framing in
outline the legislation that the country, as distinguished
from special interests, really needs.
These men, from the very nature of the case,
will be wholly free from the local pressure of
special interests so keenly felt by every man
who is dependent upon the vote of a particular
district every two years for his continuance
in public life. Such a river and harbor commission
could report, and probably would report,
a great and comprehensive National
scheme for river and harbor improvements
fit to be considered by the people as a whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>upon its merits, and not dependent for enactment
into law upon a system of log-rolling
designed to placate special interests which are
powerful in each of many score Congressional
districts. Such a tariff commission could get
at the facts of labor cost here and abroad by
expert inquiry, and not by the acceptance of
interested testimony; such a commission could
consider dispassionately the probable effect
upon the entire social and economic body of
all changes in any given branch of the tariff,
and its recommendations would represent the
exercise of careful judgment from a disinterested
standpoint. Such a commission could
work in harmony with the Commissioner of
Labor, so as to insure that the laborers for
whom the tariff is passed get the full benefit
of it; for the major part of the benefit of a
protective tariff should unquestionably go to
the wage-workers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even under such conditions of tariff-making
errors might be committed, but they would be
merely those errors of disinterested judgment
incidental to every kind of public or, for the
matter of that, private effort, and the work
would not be hampered from the beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>by the need of gratifying private selfishness.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is only in this way that tariff legislation,
river and harbor legislation, and pension legislation
can be treated from the standpoint of
principle and not from the very low standpoint
of privilege and preference. The
obstacle hitherto to the adoption of such a
method of treatment has come from the queer
dislike felt by so many Congressional leaders
to a course of action which they (quite unjustifiably)
feel would in some way be a limitation
of their powers. I think this feeling is
passing. It is simply another instance of the
kind of feeling which makes some executives
suspicious about delegating their work to any
subordinate, and which makes many voters,
who have not pondered the matter deeply,
desire to elect great numbers of people on a
ticket of such length that it is out of the
question for any except professional politicians
to know much about them.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as business becomes at all complex—and
nothing can be more complex than the
business of a Nation of a hundred million
people—it can only be performed by delegating
to experts the duty of dealing with all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>can properly be delegated. It is only by such
delegation that it is possible to secure the
proper consideration of the exceedingly important
business which cannot properly be
delegated. The voters, as a whole, for instance,
must necessarily declare directly upon
all really vital issues, and they should do this
when the issue is a man just as much as when
the issue is one of legislation. Indeed, in
my judgment, there are certain matters, as to
which the voters do not at present have the
chance of thus acting directly, where it is
important that the chance be given them. But
they can only exercise such choice with wisdom
and benefit where it is vitally necessary
to exercise it, on condition of not being confused
by the requirement of exercising it in
the great multitude of cases where there is no
such necessity, and where they can with
advantage delegate the duty to the man they
deem most fit to do the business.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is true of the voters is equally true
of legislators and administrators the moment
that their tasks become sufficiently complex.
The village constable in a small community
can do all his work directly. But the President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of the United States can do his work at
all only by delegating the enormous mass of
it to his appointees, and by confining his own
share of the purely administrative work
largely to supervision and direction of these
employees. When a President appoints a
commission to investigate such a vital matter
as, for instance, country life, or the conservation
of natural resources, he does not abdicate
his own authority; he merely faces the fact
that by no possibility can he himself do this
important piece of work as well as the experts
whom he appoints to devote their whole time
to that purpose. Now, Congress can with
wisdom act in such matters of prime legislative
importance as the tariff and river and
harbor improvement, in the same way that
the President acts in such matters of prime
administrative importance as country life and
conservation. It no more represents abdication
of power on the part of Congress to
appoint a first-class Tariff Commission than
it represents abdication of power on the part
of the President to appoint a first-class Country
Life or Conservation Commission, or than
it represents abdication of power on the part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of voters to elect as Governor a man to whom
they give all possible power to do his work
well. In each case the body delegating the
authority, so far from abdicating the power,
has secured its wise use by intrusting it to a
man or men especially equipped thus to use
it well, and this man, or these men, can in
turn be held to the most rigid accountability
if it is not well used, in the exclusive service
of the people as a whole.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Rural Life</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There are no two public questions of
more vital importance to the future
of this country than the problem of
Conservation and the problem of the betterment
of country life. Moreover, these two
problems are really interdependent, for
neither of them can be successfully solved
save on condition that there is at least a
measurable success in the effort to solve the
other. In any great country the prime
physical asset—the physical asset more valuable
than any other—is the fertility of the
soil. All our industrial and commercial welfare,
all our material development of every
kind, depends in the last resort upon our preserving
and increasing the fertility of the
soil. This, of course, means the conservation
of the soil as the great natural resource; and
equally, of course, it furthermore implies the
development of country life, for there cannot
be a permanent improvement of the soil if
the life of those who live on it, and make their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>living out of it, is suffered to starve and languish,
to become stunted and weazened and
inferior to the type of life lived elsewhere.
We are now trying to preserve, not for exploitation
by individuals, but for the permanent
benefit of the whole people, the waters and
the forests, and we are doing this primarily
as a means of adding to the fertility of the
soil; although in each case there is a great
secondary use both of the water and of the
forests for commercial and industrial purposes.
In the same way it is essential for the
farmers themselves to try to broaden the life
of the man who lives in the open country; to
make it more attractive; to give it every
adjunct and aid to development which has
been given to the life of the man of the cities.
Therefore the conservation and rural life
policies are really two sides of the same
policy; and down at bottom this policy rests
upon the fundamental law that neither man
nor nation can prosper unless, in dealing with
the present, thought is steadily taken for the
future.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one sense this problem with which we
have to deal is very, very old. Wherever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>civilizations have hitherto sprung up they
have always tended to go through certain
stages and then to fall. No nation can
develop a real civilization without cities. Up
to a certain point the city movement is
thoroughly healthy; yet it is a strange and
lamentable fact that always hitherto after this
point has been reached the city has tended to
develop at the expense of the country by draining
the country of what is best in it, and making
an insignificant return for this best. In
consequence, in the past, every civilization in
its later stages has tended really to witness
those conditions under which “the cities prosper
and the men decay.” There are ugly
signs that these tendencies are at work in this
nation of ours. But very fortunately we see
now what never before was seen in any civilization—an
aroused and alert public interest
in the problem, a recognition of its gravity
and a desire to attempt its solution.</p>

<p class='c010'>The problem does not consist merely in
the growth of the city. Such a growth in
itself is a good thing and not a bad thing for
the country. The problem consists in the
growth of the city at the expense of the country;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and, even where this is not the case, in
so great an equality of growth in power and
interest as to make the city more attractive
than the country, and therefore apt to drain
the country of the people who ought to live
therein.</p>

<p class='c010'>The human side of the rural life problem
is to make the career of the farmer and the
career of the farm laborer as attractive and
as remunerative as corresponding careers in
the city. Now, I am well aware that the
farmer must himself take the lead in bringing
this about. A century and a quarter ago the
wise English farmer, Arthur Young, wrote
of the efforts to improve French wool: “A
cultivator at the head of a sheep farm of
3,000 or 4,000 acres would in a few years do
more for their wools than all the academicians
and philosophers will effect in ten centuries.”
It is absurd to think that any man who has
studied the subject only theoretically is fit to
direct those who practically work at the matter.
But I wish to insist to you here—to you
practical men, who own and work your farms—that
it is an equally pernicious absurdity
for the practical man to refuse to benefit by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the work of the student. The English
farmer I have quoted, Young, was a practical
farmer, but he was also a scientific farmer.
One reason why the great business men of
to-day—the great industrial leaders—have
gone ahead, while the farmer has tended to
sag behind the others, is that they are far
more willing, and indeed eager, to profit by
expert and technical knowledge—the knowledge
that can come only as a result of the
highest education. From railways to factories
no great industrial concern can nowadays
be carried on save by the aid of a swarm
of men who have received a high technical
education in chemistry, in engineering, in
electricity, in one or more of scores of special
subjects. The big business man, the big railway
man, does not ask college-trained experts
to tell him how to run his business; but he
does ask numbers of them each to give him
expert advice and aid on some one point
indispensable to his business. He finds this
man usually in some graduate of a technical
school or college in which he has been trained
for his life work.</p>

<p class='c010'>In just the same way the farmers should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>benefit by the advice of the technical men
who have been trained in phases of the very
work the farmer does. I am not now speaking
of the man who has had an ordinary general
training, whether in school or college.
While there should undoubtedly be such a
training as a foundation (the extent differing
according to the kind of work each boy intends
to do as a man), it is nevertheless true that
our educational system should more and more
be turned in the direction of educating men
towards, and not away from, the farm and
the shop. During the last half-century we
have begun to develop a system of agricultural
education at once practical and scientific,
and we must go on developing it. But, after
developing it, it must be used. The rich man
who spends a fortune upon a fancy farm, with
entire indifference to cost, does not do much
good to farming; but, on the other hand, just
as little is done by the working farmer who
stolidly refuses to profit by the knowledge of
the day; who treats any effort at improvement
as absurd on its face, refuses to countenance
what he regards as new-fangled ideas and
contrivances, and jeers at all “book farming.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>I wish I could take representatives of this
type of farmer down to Long Island, where I
live, to have them see what has been done, not
as philanthropy but as a plain business proposition,
by men connected with the Long Island
Railroad, who believe it pays to encourage
the development of farms along the line of
that railway. They have put practical men
in charge of experimental farms, cultivating
them intensively, and using the best modern
methods, not only in raising crops, but in
securing the best market for the crops when
raised. The growth has been astounding,
and land only fifty miles from New York,
which during our entire National lifetime has
been treated as worthless, has within the last
three or four years been proved to possess a
really high value.</p>

<p class='c010'>The farmer, however, must not only make
his land pay, but he must make country life
interesting for himself and for his wife and
his sons and daughters. Our people as a
whole should realize the infinite possibilities
of life in the country; and every effort should
be made to make these possibilities more possible.
From the beginning of time it has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the man raised in the country—and usually
the man born in the country—who has been
most apt to render the services which every
nation most needs. Turning to the list of
American statesmen, it is extraordinary to see
how large a proportion started as farm boys.
But it is rather sad to see that in recent years
most of these same boys have ended their lives
as men living in cities.</p>

<p class='c010'>It often happens that the good conditions
of the past can be regained, not by going back,
but by going forward. We cannot re-create
what is dead; we cannot stop the march of
events; but we can direct this march, and out
of the new conditions develop something better
than the past knew. Henry Clay was a
farmer who lived all his life in the country;
Washington was a farmer who lived and died
in the country; and we of this Nation ought
to make it our business to see that the conditions
are made such that farm life in the
future shall not only develop men of the
stamp of Washington and Henry Clay, but
shall be so attractive that these men may continue
as farmers; for remember that Washington
and Henry Clay were successful farmers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>I hope that things will so shape themselves
that the farmer can have a great career and
yet end his life as a farmer; so that the city
man will look forward to living in the country
rather than the country man to living in the
city.</p>

<p class='c010'>Farmers should learn how to combine
effectively, as has been done in industry. I
heartily believe in farmers’ organizations; and
we should all welcome every step taken
towards an increasing co-operation among
farmers. The importance of such movements
cannot be over-estimated; and through
such intelligent joint action it will be possible
to improve the market just as much as the
farm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Country life should be as attractive as city
life, and the country people should insist upon
having their full representation when it comes
to dealing with all great public questions. In
other words, country folks should demand that
they work on equal terms with city folks in
all such matters. They should have their
share in the memberships of commissions and
councils; in short, of all the organized bodies
for laying plans for great enterprises affecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>all the people. I am glad to see on such
bodies the names that represent financial
interests, but those interests should not have
the right-of-way, and in all enterprises and
movements in which the social condition of
the country is involved, the agricultural country—the
open country—should be as well
represented as the city. The man of the open
country is apt to have certain qualities which
the city man has lost. These qualities offset
those which the city man has and he himself
has not. The two should be put on equal
terms, and the country talent be given the
same opportunity as the city talent to express
itself and to contribute to the welfare of the
world in which we live.</p>

<p class='c010'>The country church should be made a true
social center, alive to every need of the community,
standing for a broad individual outlook
and development, taking the lead in
work and in recreation, caring more for conduct
than for dogma, more for ethical, spiritual,
practical betterment than for merely
formal piety. The country fair offers far
greater possibilities for continuous and
healthy usefulness than it at present affords.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The country school should be made a vital
center for economic, social, and educational
co-operation; it is naturally fitted to be such
a center for those engaged in commercial
farming, and still more for those engaged
in domestic farming, for those who live on
and by the small farms they themselves own.
The problem of the farm is really the problem
of the family that lives on the farm. On
all these questions there is need of intelligent
study, such as marks the books of Professor
Bailey, of Cornell, and of Sir Horace Plunkett’s
book on the “Rural Life Problems of
the United States.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One feature of the problem should be recognized
by the farmer at once, and an effort
made to deal with it. It is our duty and our
business to consider the farm laborer exactly
as we consider the farmer. No country life
can be satisfactory when the owners of farms
tend, for whatever reason, to go away to live
in cities instead of working their farms; and,
moreover, it cannot be really satisfactory
when the labor system is so managed that
there is for part of the year a demand for
labor which cannot be met, and during another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>part of the year no demand for labor at all,
so that the farmers tend to rely on migratory
laborers who come out to work in the country
with no permanent interest in it and with no
prospect of steady employment. It is exceedingly
difficult to make a good citizen out of a
man who cannot count upon some steadiness
and continuity in the work which means to
him his livelihood. Economic conditions on
the farm—in variety and kind of crop-growing,
especially as distributed in time, and in
housing for the men—must be so shaped as
to render it possible for the man who labors
for the farmer to be steadily employed under
conditions which foster his self-respect and
tend for his development.</p>

<p class='c010'>Above all, the conditions of farm life must
always be shaped with a view to the welfare
of the farmer’s wife and the farm laborer’s
wife, quite as much as to the welfare of the
farmer and the farm laborer. To have the
woman a mere drudge is at least as bad as to
have the man a mere drudge. It is every
whit as important to introduce new machines
to economize her labor within the house, as it
is to introduce machinery to increase the effectiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of his labor outside the house. I
have not the slightest sympathy with any
movement which looks to excusing men and
women for the non-performance of duty and
fixes attention only on rights and not on duties.
The woman who shirks her duty as housewife,
as mother, is a contemptible creature;
just as the corresponding man is a contemptible
creature. But the welfare of the woman
is even more important than the welfare of
the man; for the mother is the real Atlas, who
bears aloft in her strong and tender arms the
destiny of the world. She deserves honor
and consideration such as no man should
receive. She forfeits all claim to this honor
and consideration if she shirks her duties.
But the average American woman does not
shirk them; and it is a matter of the highest
obligation for us to see that they are performed
under conditions which make for her
welfare and happiness and for the welfare
and happiness of the children she brings into
the world.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Progressives, Past and Present</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There have been two great crises in
our country’s history: first when it
was formed, and then again when it
was perpetuated. The formative period included
not merely the Revolutionary War,
but the creation and adoption of the Constitution
and the first dozen years of work under
it. Then came sixty years during which we
spread across the continent—years of vital
growth, but of growth without rather than
growth within. Then came the time of stress
and strain which culminated in the Civil War,
the period of terrible struggle upon the issue
of which depended the justification of all that
we had done earlier, and which marked the
second great period of growth and development
within. The name of John Brown will
be forever associated with this second period
of the Nation’s history; and Kansas was the
theater upon which the first act of the second
of our great National life dramas was played.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>It was the result of the struggle in Kansas
which determined that our country should be
in deed as well as in name devoted to both
union and freedom, that the great experiment
of democratic government on a national scale
should succeed and not fail. It was a heroic
struggle; and, as is inevitable with all such
struggles, it had also a dark and a terrible
side. Very much was done of good, and
much, also, of evil; and, as was inevitable in
such a period of revolution, often the same
man did both good and evil. For our great
good fortune as a nation, we, the people of
the United States as a whole, can now afford
to forget the evil, or at least to remember it
without bitterness, and to fix our eyes with
pride on the good that was accomplished.
Even in ordinary times there are very few of
us who do not see the problems of life as
through a glass, darkly; and when the glass
is clouded by the murk of furious popular
passion, the vision of the best and the bravest
is dimmed. Looking back, we are all of us
now able to do justice to the valor and the
disinterestedness and the love of the right as
to each it was given to see the right, shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>both by the men of the North and the men of
the South in that contest which was finally
decided by the attitude of the West. We
can see the Puritan soldier, the man of the
Bible and the sword, embodied again in
Stonewall Jackson, just as we see that Puritan
embodied in the stern soldiers who warred
against Jackson. We can admire the heroic
valor, the sincerity, the self-devotion shown
alike by the men who wore the blue and the
men who wore the gray; and our sadness that
such men should have had to fight one another
is tempered by the glad knowledge that ever
hereafter their descendants shall be found
fighting side by side, struggling in peace as
well as in war for the uplift of their common
country, all alike resolute to raise to the highest
pitch of honor and usefulness the nation
to which they all belong.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not speak of this struggle of the past
merely from the historic standpoint. Our
interest is primarily in the application to-day
of the lessons taught by the contest of half a
century ago. It is of little use for us to pay
lip loyalty to the mighty men of the past unless
we sincerely endeavor to apply to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>problems of the present precisely the qualities
which in other crises enabled the men of that
day to meet those crises. It is half melancholy
and half amusing to see the way in
which well-meaning people gather to do honor
to the men who, in company with John Brown,
and under the lead of Abraham Lincoln, faced
and solved the great problems of the nineteenth
century, while at the same time these
same good people nervously shrink from or
frantically denounce those who are trying to
meet the problems of the twentieth in the
spirit which was accountable for the successful
solution of the problems of Lincoln’s
time.</p>

<p class='c010'>John Brown stands to us now as representing
the men and the generation who rendered
the greatest service ever rendered this country.
He stood for heroic valor, grim energy,
fierce fidelity to high ideals. A great debt
is owed to John Brown because he is one of
the most striking figures in the mighty struggle
which was to keep us forever a free and
united nation, which was to secure the continuance
of the most tremendous democratic
experiment ever tried. He did much in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>life and more in his death; he embodied the
inspiration of the men of his generation; his
fate furnished the theme of the song which
most stirred the hearts of the soldiers. John
Brown’s work was brought to completion,
was made perfect, by the men who bore aloft
the banner of the Union during the four terrible
years which intervened between Sumter
and Appomattox. To the soldiers who
fought through those years—and of course
to a very few of their civilian chiefs, like Lincoln—is
due the supreme debt of the Nation.
They alone, of all our people since we became
a nation, rendered to us and to all who come
after us a service literally indispensable.
They occupy the highest and most honorable
position ever occupied by any men of any
generation in our country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of that generation of men to whom we
owe so much, the man to whom we owe most
is, of course, Lincoln. Valor, energy, disinterestedness,
idealism—all these were his;
and his also was that lofty and far-seeing wisdom
which alone could make the valor, the
disinterestedness, the energy, the idealism, of
service to the Republic. Here again, in meeting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the problems of to-day, let us profit by,
and welcome, and co-operate with the John
Browns; but let us also remember that the
problems can really be solved only if we
approach them in the spirit of Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c010'>John Brown prepared the way; but if
the friends of freedom and union had surrendered
themselves to his leadership, the cause
of freedom and union would have been lost.
After his death Lincoln spoke of him as
follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“John Brown’s effort was peculiar. It was
not a slave insurrection. It was an attempt
by white men to get up a revolt among slaves
in which the slaves refused to participate. In
fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all
their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could
not succeed. That affair, in its philosophy,
corresponds with the many attempts related
in history at the assassination of kings and
emperors. An enthusiast broods over the
oppression of a people till he fancies himself
commissioned by Heaven to liberate them.
He ventures the attempt, which ends in little
less than his own execution. Orsini’s attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>on Louis Napoleon and John Brown’s attempt
at Harper’s Ferry were, in their philosophy,
precisely the same. The eagerness to cast
blame on Old England in the one case and on
New England in the other does not disprove
the sameness of the two things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In our struggle to-day we can study Lincoln’s
career purely as an example to emulate;
we can study John Brown’s career partly as
such an example, but partly also as a warning.
I think such study is especially necessary for
the extremists among the very men with whom
my own sympathy is especially keen. I am
a progressive; I could not be anything else;
indeed, as the years go by I become more, and
not less, radically progressive. To my mind
the failure resolutely to follow progressive
policies is the negation of democracy as well
of progress, and spells disaster. But for this
very reason I feel concern when progressives
act with heedless violence, or go so far and
so fast as to invite reaction. The experience
of John Brown illustrates the evil of the
revolutionary short-cut to ultimate good ends.
The liberty of the slave was desirable, but it
was not to be brought about by a slave insurrection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The better distribution of property
is desirable, but it is not to be brought about
by the anarchic form of Socialism which
would destroy all private capital and tend to
destroy all private wealth. It represents not
progress, but retrogression, to propose to
destroy capital because the power of unrestrained
capital is abused. John Brown rendered
a great service to the cause of liberty
in the earlier Kansas days; but his notion that
the evils of slavery could be cured by a slave
insurrection was a delusion analogous to the
delusions of those who expect to cure the evils
of plutocracy by arousing the baser passions
of workingmen against the rich in an endeavor
at violent industrial revolution. And, on the
other hand, the brutal and shortsighted greed
of those who profit by what is wrong in the
present system, and the attitude of those who
oppose all effort to do away with this wrong,
serve in their turn as incitements to such revolution;
just as the insolence of the ultra proslavery
men finally precipitated the violent
destruction of slavery.</p>

<p class='c010'>In one of Lincoln’s addresses immediately
after his second election, at a time when any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>man of less serene magnanimity would have
been tempted to advocate extreme measures
and to betray personal exultation, or even to
show hatred of his opponents, he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Human nature will not change. In any
future great national affair, compared with
the men of this, we shall have as weak and as
strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as
good. Let us therefore study the incidents
of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from,
and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.
May not all having a common interest reunite
in a common effort to save our common country?
For my own part, I have striven and
shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in
the way. So long as I have been here I have
not willingly planted a thorn in any man’s
bosom. May I ask those who have not differed
with me to join with me in this same
spirit towards those who have?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Surely such a union of indomitable resolution
in the achievement of a given purpose,
with patience and moderation in the policy
pursued, and with kindly charity and consideration
and friendliness to those of opposite
belief, marks the very spirit in which we of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>to-day should approach the pressing problems
of the present.</p>

<p class='c010'>These problems have to do with securing
a more just and generally widespread welfare,
so that there may be a more substantial measure
of equality in moral and physical well-being
among the people whom the men of
Lincoln’s day kept undivided as citizens of a
single country, and freed from the curse of
negro slavery. They did their part; now let
us do ours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fundamentally, our chief problem may be
summed up as the effort to make men, as
nearly as they can be made, both free and
equal; the freedom and equality necessarily
resting on a basis of justice and brotherhood.
It is not possible, with the imperfections of
mankind, ever wholly to achieve such an
ideal, if only for the reason that the shortcomings
of men are such that complete and
unrestricted individual liberty would mean the
negation of even approximate equality, while
a rigid and absolute equality would imply the
destruction of every shred of liberty. Our
business is to secure a practical working combination
between the two. This combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>should aim, on the one hand, to secure to each
man the largest measure of individual liberty
that is compatible with his fellows’ getting
from life a just share of the good things to
which they are legitimately entitled; while,
on the other hand, it should aim to bring about
among well-behaved, hard-working people a
measure of equality which shall be substantial,
and which shall yet permit to the individual
the personal liberty of achievement and
reward without which life would not be worth
living, without which all progress would stop,
and civilization first stagnate and then go
backwards. Such a combination cannot be
completely realized. It can be realized at
all only by the application of the spirit of
fraternity, the spirit of brotherhood. This
spirit demands that each man shall learn and
apply the principle that his liberty must be
used not only for his own benefit but for the
interest of the community as a whole, while
the community in its turn, acting as a whole,
shall understand that while it must insist on
its own rights as against the individual, it
must also scrupulously safeguard these same
rights of the individual.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Lincoln set before us forever our ideal
when he stated that this country was dedicated
to a government of, by, and for the people.
Our whole experiment is meaningless unless
we are to make this a democracy in the fullest
sense of the word, in the broadest as well as
the highest and deepest significance of the
word. It must be made a democracy economically
as well as politically. This does not
mean that there shall not be leadership in the
economic as in the political world, or that
there shall not be ample reward for high distinction
and great service. Quite the contrary.
It is our boast that in our political
affairs we have combined genuine political
equality with high distinction in individual
service. During a century and a third we
here on this continent—more completely than
anywhere else at any other time—have actually
realized the democratic principle, the
principle of popular government. Yet during
this period we have produced, in the persons
of Washington and Lincoln, two leaders
who on the roll of the world’s worthies stand
higher than any other two men ever produced
by any other country during a similar length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of time. We believe that it is entirely possible
to combine equality of rights and at least
an approximate equality in the opportunity
to achieve material well-being, with the opportunity
for the highest kind of individual distinction.
Hitherto our efforts towards this
end have related to purely political matters;
we must now strive to achieve the same end
in economic matters.</p>

<p class='c010'>To achieve our purpose we cannot trust
merely to haphazard, easy-going methods
with complete absence of official Government
action and a too exclusively material standard.
These did well enough in the pioneer days
when problems were comparatively simple,
and when the country was still so large that
Uncle Sam could give every man a farm, so
that, if any man did not succeed where he
was, all he had to do was to move somewhere
else. We must be true to the spirit of our
ancestors, and therefore we must avoid any
servility to the letter of what they said and
did. There must be equal rights for all, and
special privileges for none; but we must remember
that to achieve this ideal it is necessary
to construe rights and privileges very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>differently from the way they were necessarily
construed, by statesmen and people alike, a
century ago. We must strive to achieve our
ideal by an exercise of governmental power
which the conditions did not render necessary
a century ago, and of which our forefathers
would have felt suspicious. This is no reflection
on the wisdom of our forefathers; it is
simply an acknowledgment that conditions
have now changed. If our farmers now used
the wasteful methods that served for their
great-grandfathers, they would not merely
fail in the present, but would work a grave
wrong to the American citizens of the future.
In the same way we must apply new political
methods to meet the new political needs, or
else we shall suffer, and our children also. In
the same way, when we speak of the “square
deal,” we include two thoughts, each supplementary
to the other. The square deal can
be secured in part by honest enforcement of
existing laws, by honest application of the
principles upon which this Government was
founded, by the exercise of an aroused and
enlightened public opinion. But in order
completely to secure it, there must be whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>legislation is necessary to meet the new
conditions caused by the extraordinary industrial
change and development that have taken
place during the last two generations. The
greatest evils in our industrial system to-day
are those which rise from the abuses of aggregated
wealth; and our great problem is to
overcome these evils and cut out these abuses.
No one man can deal with this matter. It is
the affair of the people as a whole. When
aggregated wealth demands what is unfair,
its immense power can be met only by the still
greater power of the people as a whole,
exerted in the only way it can be exerted,
through the Government; and we must be
resolutely prepared to use the power of
the Government to any needed extent, even
though it be necessary to tread paths which
are yet untrod. The complete change in
economic conditions means that governmental
methods never yet resorted to may have to be
employed in order to deal with them. We
cannot tolerate anything approaching a monopoly,
especially in the necessaries of life,
except on terms of such thoroughgoing
governmental control as will absolutely safeguard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>every right of the public. Moreover,
one of the most sinister manifestations of
great corporate wealth during recent years
has been its tendency to interfere and dominate
in politics.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not merely that we want to see the
game played fairly. We also want to see the
rules changed, so that there shall be both less
opportunity and less temptation to cheat, and
less chance for some few people to gain a
profit to which either they are not entitled at
all, or else which is so enormous as to be
greatly in excess of what they deserve, even
though their services have been great. We
wish to do away with the profit that comes
from the illegitimate exercise of cunning and
craft. We also wish to secure a measurable
equality of opportunity, a measurable
equality of reward for services of similar
value. To do all this, two mutually supplementary
movements are necessary. On
the one hand, there must be—I think there
now is—a genuine and permanent moral
awakening, without which no wisdom of legislation
or administration really means anything;
and, on the other hand, we must try
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>to secure the social and economic legislation
without which any improvement due to purely
moral agitation is necessarily evanescent.</p>

<p class='c010'>We pride ourselves upon being a practical
people, and therefore we should not be
merely empirical in seeking to bring about
results. We must set the end in view as the
goal; and then, instead of making a fetish of
some particular kind of means, we should
adopt whatever honorable means will best
accomplish the end. In so far as unrestricted
individual liberty brings the best results, we
should encourage it. But when a point is
reached where this complete lack of restriction
on individual liberty fails to achieve the best
results, then, on behalf of the whole people,
we should exercise the collective power of the
people, through the State Legislatures in matters
of purely local concern, and through the
National Legislature when the purpose is so
big that only National action can achieve it.
There are good people who, being discontented
with present-day conditions, think that
these conditions can be cured by a return to
what they call the “principles of the fathers.”
In so far as we have departed from the standards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of lofty integrity in public and private
life to which the greatest men among the
founders of the Republic adhered, why, of
course, we should return to these principles.
We must always remember that no system of
legislation can accomplish anything unless
back of it we have the right type of National
character; unless we have ideals to which our
practice measurably conforms. But to go
back to the governmental theories of a hundred
years ago would accomplish nothing
whatever; for it was under the conditions of
unrestricted individualism and freedom from
Government interference, countenanced by
those theories, that the trusts grew up, and
private fortunes, enormous far beyond the
deserts of the accumulators, were gathered.
The old theories of government worked well
in sparsely settled communities, before steam,
electricity, and machinery had revolutionized
our industrial system; but to return to them
now would be as hopeless as for the farmers
of the present to return to the agricultural
implements which met the needs of their predecessors,
the farmers who followed in the
footsteps of Daniel Boone to Kentucky and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Missouri. It may be that, in the past development
of our country, complete freedom
from all restrictions, and the consequent unlimited
encouragement and reward given to
the most successful industrial leaders, played
a part in which the benefits outweighed the
disadvantages. But nowadays such is not
the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lincoln had to meet special and peculiar
problems, and therefore there was no need
and no opportunity for him to devote attention
to those other problems which we face,
and which in his day were so much less intense
than in ours. Nevertheless, he very clearly
put the proper democratic view when he said:
“I hold that while man exists it is his duty to
improve not only his own condition but to
assist in ameliorating mankind.” And again:
“Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital;
capital is only the fruit of labor, and
could never have existed but for labor. Labor
is the superior of capital, and deserves much
the higher consideration. Capital has its
rights which are as worthy of protection as
any other rights.... Nor should this lead
to a war upon the owners of property. Property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>is the fruit of labor; property is desirable;
is a positive good in the world. Let
not him who is houseless pull down the house
of another, but let him work diligently and
build one for himself, thus by example showing
that his own shall be safe from violence
when built.” It seems to me that in these
words Lincoln took substantially the attitude
that we ought to take; he showed the proper
sense of proportion in his relative estimate of
capital and labor, of human rights and property
rights. Above all, in this speech, as in
so many others, he taught a lesson in wise
kindliness and charity; an indispensable lesson
to us of to-day, for if we approach the work
of reform in a spirit of vindictiveness—in a
spirit of reckless disregard for the rights of
others, or of hatred for men because they are
better off than ourselves—we are sure in the
end to do not good but damage to all mankind,
and especially to those whose especial
champions we profess ourselves to be. Violent
excess is sure to provoke violent reaction;
and the worst possible policy for our country
would be one of violent oscillation between
reckless upsetting of property rights, and unscrupulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>greed manifested under pretense
of protecting those rights. The agitator who
preaches hatred and practices slander and untruthfulness,
and the visionary who promises
perfection and accomplishes only destruction,
are the worst enemies of reform; and the man
of great wealth who accumulates and uses his
wealth without regard to ethical standards,
who profits by and breeds corruption, and robs
and swindles others, is the very worst enemy
of property, the very worst enemy of conservatism,
the very worst enemy of those “business
interests” that only too often regard him
with mean admiration and heatedly endeavor
to shield him from the consequences of his
iniquity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, the object we seek to achieve is twofold.
A great democratic commonwealth
should seek to produce and reward that individual
distinction which results in the efficient
performance of needed work, for such performance
is of high value to the whole community.
But hand in hand with this purpose
must go the purpose which Abraham Lincoln
designated as the “amelioration of mankind.”
Only by an intelligent effort to realize this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>joint process of individual and social betterment
can we keep our democracy sound. We
all admit this to be true politically; but we
have not paid much heed to the question from
its economic side. The wage-earner primarily
needs what it is pre-eminently to the interest
of our democratic commonwealth that he
should obtain—that is, a high standard of
living, and the opportunity to acquire the
means whereby to secure it. Every power of
the Nation should be used in helping him to
this end; taking care, however, that the help
shall be given in such fashion as to represent
real help, and not harm; for the worst injury
that could be done him or any other man
would be to teach him to rely primarily on
“the State” instead of on himself. The collective
power of the State can help; but it is
the individual’s own power of self-help which
is most important.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, I am well aware that demagogues
and doctrinaire reformers of a certain type
may try to turn such use of the powers of the
State into an abuse. We should set our faces
like flint against any such abuse. We should
make it fully understood by the workingmen—by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the men of small means—that we will
do everything in our power for them <i>except
what is wrong;</i> but that we will do wrong for
no man—neither for them nor for any one
else. Nevertheless, the fact that there are
dangers in following a given course merely
means that we should follow it with a cautious
realization of these dangers, and not that we
should abandon it, if on the whole it is the
right course.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is just so with personal liberty. The
unlimited freedom which the individual property-owner
has enjoyed has been of use to this
country in many ways, and we can continue
our prosperous economic career only by retaining
an economic organization which will offer
to the men of the stamp of the great captains
of industry the opportunity and inducement
to earn distinction. Nevertheless, we as
Americans must now face the fact that this
great freedom which the individual property-owner
has enjoyed in the past has produced
evils which were inevitable from its unrestrained
exercise. It is this very freedom—this
absence of State and National restraint—that
has tended to create a small class of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>enormously wealthy and economically powerful
men whose chief object is to hold and
increase their power. Any feeling of special
hatred toward these men is as absurd as any
feeling of special regard. Some of them have
gained their power by cheating and swindling,
just as some very small business men cheat
and swindle; but, as a whole, big men are no
better and no worse than their small competitors,
from a moral standpoint. Where they
do wrong it is even more important to punish
them than to punish a small man who does
wrong, because their position makes it especially
wicked for them to yield to temptation;
but the prime need is to change the conditions
which enable them to accumulate a power
which it is not for the general welfare that
they should hold or exercise, and to make this
change not only without vindictiveness, without
doing injustice to individuals, but also in
a cautious and temperate spirit, testing our
theories by actual practice, so that our legislation
may represent the minimum of restrictions
upon the individual initiative of the
exceptional man which is compatible with
obtaining the maximum of welfare for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>average man. We grudge no man a fortune
which represents merely his own power and
sagacity exercised with entire regard to the
welfare of his fellows. But the fortune must
not only be honorably obtained and well used;
it is also essential that it should not represent
a necessary incident of widespread, even
though partial, economic privation. It is not
even enough that the fortune should have
been gained without doing damage to the
community. We should only permit it to be
gained and kept so long as the gaining and
the keeping represent benefit to the community.
This I know implies a policy of a far
more active governmental interference with
social and economic conditions than we have
hitherto seen in this country; but I think we
have to face the fact that such increase in governmental
activity is now necessary. We
should work cautiously and patiently and with
complete absence of animosity, except toward
the individuals whom we are certain have been
guilty of flagrant evil; but we should also
work firmly to realize the democratic purpose,
economically and socially as well as
politically. We must make popular government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>responsible for the betterment both of
the individual and of society at large.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me repeat once more that, while such
responsible governmental action is an absolutely
necessary thing to achieve our purpose,
yet it will be worse than useless if it is not
accompanied by a serious effort on the part
of the individuals composing the community
thus to achieve each for himself a higher
standard of individual betterment, not merely
material but spiritual and intellectual. In
other words, our democracy depends on individual
improvement just as much as upon collective
effort to achieve our common social
improvement. The most serious troubles of
the present day are unquestionably due in
large part to lack of efficient governmental
action, and cannot be remedied without such
action; but neither can any remedy permanently
avail unless back of it stands a high
general character of individual citizenship.</p>

<p class='c010'>This governmental improvement can be
accomplished partly by the States, in so far
as any given evil affects only one State, or one
or two States; in so far as a merely local
remedy is needed for a merely local disease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>But the betterment must be accomplished
partly, and I believe mainly, through the
National Government. I do not ask for
over-centralization; but I do ask that we work
in a spirit of broad and far-reaching nationalism
when we deal with what concerns our
people as a whole. I no more make a fetish
of centralization than of decentralization.
Any given case must be treated on its special
merits. Each community should be required
to deal with all that is of merely local interest;
and nothing should be undertaken by the Government
of the whole country which can thus
wisely be left to local management. But
those functions of government which no wisdom
on the part of the States will enable
them satisfactorily to perform must be performed
by the National Government. We
are all Americans; our common interests are
as broad as the continent; the most vital problems
are those that affect us all alike. The
regulation of big business, and therefore the
control of big property in the public interest,
are pre-eminently instances of such functions
which can only be performed efficiently and
wisely by the Nation; and, moreover, so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>as labor is employed in connection with inter-State
business, it should also be treated as a
matter for the National Government. The
National power over inter-State commerce
warrants our dealing with such questions as
employers’ liability in inter-State business, and
the protection and compensation for injuries
of railway employees. The National Government
of right has, and must exercise, its
power for the protection of labor which is
connected with the instrumentalities of inter-State
commerce.</p>

<p class='c010'>The National Government belongs to the
whole American people; and where the whole
American people are interested that interest
can be effectively guarded only by the National
Government. We ought to use the
National Government as an agency, a tool,
wherever it is necessary, in order that we may
organize our entire political, economical, and
social life in accordance with a far-reaching
democratic purpose. We should make the
National governmental machinery an adequate
and constructive instrument for constructive
work in the realization of a National
democratic ideal. I lay emphasis upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>word <i>constructive</i>. Too often the Federal
Government, and above all the Federal judiciary,
has permitted itself to be employed for
purely negative purposes—that is, to thwart
the action of the States while not permitting
efficient National action in its place. From
the National standpoint nothing can be worse—nothing
can be full of graver menace—for
the National life than to have the Federal
courts active in nullifying State action to
remedy the evils arising from the abuse of
great wealth, unless the Federal authorities,
executive, legislative, and judicial alike, do
their full duty in effectually meeting the need
of a thoroughgoing and radical supervision
and control of big inter-State business in all its
forms. Many great financiers, and many of
the great corporation lawyers who advise
them, still oppose any effective regulation of
big business by the National Government,
because, for the time being, it serves their
interest to trust to the chaos which is caused
on the one hand by inefficient laws and conflicting
and often unwise efforts at regulation
by State governments, and, on the other hand,
by the efficient protection against such regulation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>afforded by the Federal courts. In the
end this condition will prove intolerable, and
will hurt most of all the very class which it at
present benefits. The continuation of such
conditions would mean that the corporations
would find that they had purchased immunity
from the efficient exercise of Federal regulative
power at the cost of being submitted to
a violent and radical local supervision, inflamed
to fury by having repeatedly been
thwarted, and not chastened by exercised
responsibility. To refuse to take, or to permit
others to take, wise and practical action
for the remedying of abuses is to invite unwise
action under the lead of violent extremists.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not wish to see the Nation forced into
ownership of the railways if it can possibly
be avoided; and the only alternative is
thoroughgoing and effective regulation, which
shall be based on full knowledge of all the
facts, including a physical valuation of the
property, the details of its capitalization, and
the like. We should immediately set about
securing this physical valuation. The Government
should oversee the issuance of all
stocks and bonds, and should have complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>power over rates and traffic agreements. The
railways are really highways, and it is the
fundamental right of the people as a whole
to see that they are open to use on just and
reasonable terms, equal to all persons. The
Hepburn Bill marked a great step in advance;
the law of last session, in its final shape and
as actually passed, marks, on the whole, another
decided step in advance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Corporate regulation is merely one phase
of a vast problem. The true friend of property,
the true conservative, is he who insists
that property shall be the servant and not the
master of the commonwealth; who insists that
the creature of man’s making shall be the
servant and not the master of the man who
made it. The citizens of the United States
must effectively control the mighty commercial
forces which they have themselves called
into being.</p>

<p class='c010'>Corporations are necessary to the effective
use of the forces of production and commerce
under modern conditions. We cannot effectively
prohibit all combinations without doing
far-reaching economic harm; and it is mere
folly to do as we have done in the past—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>try to combine incompatible systems—that is,
to try both to prohibit and regulate combinations.
Combinations in industry are the
result of an imperative economic law which
cannot be repealed by political legislation.
The effort at prohibiting all combination has
substantially failed. The only course left is
active corporate regulation—that is, the control
of corporations for the common good—the
suppression of the evils that they work,
and the retention, as far as may be, of that
business efficiency in their use which has placed
us in the forefront of industrial peoples. I
need waste no words upon our right so to
control them. The corporation is the creature
of government, and the people have the right
to handle it as they desire; all they need pay
attention to is the expediency of realizing this
right in some way that shall be productive of
good and not harm. The corporate manager
who achieves success by honest efficiency in
giving the best service to the public should be
favored because we all benefit by his efficiency.
He realizes Abraham Lincoln’s definition
which I have quoted above, because he works
for his own material betterment and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>same time for the “amelioration of mankind,”
and he should be helped by the Government
because his success is good for the National
welfare. But a man who grasps and holds
business power by breaking the industrial
efficiency of others, who wins success by
methods which are against the public interest
and degrading to the public morals, should
not be permitted to exercise such power. Instead
of punishing him by a long and doubtful
process of the law after the wrong has been
committed, there should be such effective Government
regulation as to check the evil tendencies
at the moment that they start to develop.
Overcapitalization in all its shapes is one of
the prime evils; for it is one of the most fruitful
methods by which unscrupulous men get
improper profits, and when the holdings come
into innocent hands we are forced into the
uncomfortable position of being obliged to
reduce the dividends of innocent investors, or
of permitting the public and the wage-workers,
either or both, to suffer. Such really
effective control over great inter-State business
can come only from the National Government.
The American people demands the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>new Nationalism needful to deal with the new
problems; it puts the National need above
sectional or personal advantage; it is impatient
of the utter confusion which results from
local legislatures attempting to treat National
issues as local issues; it is still more impatient
of the National impotence which springs from
the over-division of governmental powers; the
impotence which makes it possible for local
selfishness, or for the vulpine legal cunning
which is hired by wealthy special interests, to
bring National activities to a deadlock.</p>

<p class='c010'>The control must be exercised in several
different ways. It may be that National incorporation
is not at the moment possible; but
there must be some affirmative National control,
on terms which will secure publicity in
the affairs of and complete supervision and
control over the big, Nation-wide business
corporations; a control that will prevent and
not legalize abuses. Such control should
imply the issuance of securities by corporations
only under thoroughgoing Governmental
supervision, and after compliance with Governmental
requirements which shall effectually
prevent overcapitalization. Such control
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>should protect and favor the corporation
which acts honestly, exactly as it should check
and punish, when it cannot prevent, every
species of dishonesty.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Inter-State Commerce Commission
and in the Federal Bureau of Corporations
we have bodies which, if their powers are sufficiently
enlarged after the right fashion, can
render great and substantial service. The
average American citizen should have presented
to him in a simple and easily comprehended
form the truth about the business
affairs that affect his daily life as consumer,
employee, employer, as investor, as voter.
The issue of securities should be subject to
rigorous Government supervision. There
are concrete instances of unfair competition
that can be reached under the Federal criminal
legislation, and they should be attacked
and destroyed in the courts. But the laws
should be such that normally, and save in
extraordinary circumstances, there should be
no need of recourse to the courts. What is
needed is administrative supervision and control.
This should be so exercised that the
highways of commerce and opportunity should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>be open to all; and not nominally open, but
really open, a consistent effort being made to
deprive every man of any advantage that is
not due to his own superiority and efficiency,
controlled by moral purpose. The National
Bureau of Corporations has not been given
the powers or the funds to develop its full
usefulness, and yet it offers one of the prime
means at the disposal of the people of keeping
them fully acquainted with all the facts about
corporation control. We have a right to
expect from this Bureau and from the Inter-State
Commerce Commission a very high
grade of public service. We should be as
sure of the proper conduct of inter-State
railways and the proper management of inter-State
business as we are now sure of the
conduct and management of the National
banks, and we should have as effective supervision
in one case as in the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only as a matter of justice and honesty,
but as a matter of prime popular interest, we
should see that this control is so exercised as
to favor a proper return to the upright business
manager and honest investor. In the
matter of railway rates, for instance, it is just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>as much our duty to see that they are not too
low as that they are not too high. We must
preserve the right of the railway employee to
proper wages and the right of the investor to
proper interest as scrupulously as we preserve
the right of the shipper and the producer and
the consumer. We cannot afford to do injustice,
or suffer it to be done, to any of these.
But in order to do justice we must have full
knowledge. We must have the right to find
out every fact connected with the business of
the railway, so as to base our judgment, not
on any one fact, but on all taken together.
Inasmuch as it is so often impossible to punish
wrongs done in the past, and to prevent the
consequences of the wrongs thus committed
being felt by one innocent class, without shifting
the burden to the shoulders of another
innocent class, we ought to provide that hereafter
business shall be carried on from its inception
in such a way as to prevent swindling.
Incidentally, this will also tend to prevent that
excessive profit by one man, which may not be
swindling, under existing laws, but which
nevertheless is against the interest of the commonwealth;
To know all the facts is of as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>much interest to the investor and the wageworker
as to the shipper, the producer, the
consumer. Full knowledge of the past helps
us in dealing with the future. If we find that
high rates are due to overcapitalization in the
past, or to any kind of sharp practice in the
past, then, whether or not it is possible to take
action which will partly remedy the wrong,
we are certainly in a better position to prevent
a repetition of the wrong.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me, in closing, put my position in a nutshell.
When I say that I am for the square
deal, I mean not merely that I stand for fair
play under the present rules of the game, but
that I stand for having these rules changed
so as to work for a more substantial equality
of opportunity and of reward for equally
good service. So far as possible, the reward
should be based upon service; and this necessarily
implies that where a man renders us
service in return for the fortune he receives,
he has the right to receive it only on terms just
to the whole people. For this reason there
should be a heavily progressive National
inheritance tax on big fortunes. The really
big fortune, by the mere fact of its size,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>acquires qualities which differentiate it in kind
as well as in degree from what is possessed by
men of relatively small means. A heavily
progressive inheritance tax on all such fortunes
(heaviest on absentees) has the good
qualities of an income tax, without its drawbacks;
it is far more beneficial to the community
at large, and far less burdensome to
private individuals, as well as far more easily
collected. A moderate, but progressive, income
tax, carefully devised to fall genuinely
on those who ought to pay, would, I believe,
be a good thing; but a heavy and heavily progressive
inheritance tax on great fortunes
would be a far better thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have tried to set before you my creed. I
believe in property rights, but I believe in
them as adjuncts to, and not as substitutes for,
human rights. I believe that normally the
rights of property coincide with the rights of
man; but where they do not, then the rights
of man must be put above the rights of property.
I believe in shaping the ends of government
to protect property; but wherever the
alternative must be faced, I am for man and
not for property. I am far from underestimating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the importance of dividends, but I
rank dividends below human character. I
know well that if there is not sufficient prosperity
the people will in the end rebel against
any system, no matter how exalted morally;
and reformers must not bring upon the people
permanent economic ruin, or the reforms
themselves will go down in the ruin. But we
must be ready to face any temporary disaster—whether
or not brought on by those who
will war against us to the knife—if only
through such disaster can we attain our goal.
And those who oppose all reform will do well
to remember that ruin in its worst form is
inevitable if our National life brings us nothing
whatever but a swollen and badly distributed
material prosperity. In other words,
I feel that material interests are chiefly good,
not in themselves, but as an indispensable
foundation upon which we should build a
higher superstructure, a superstructure without
which the foundation becomes worthless.
Therefore I believe that the destinies of this
country should be shaped primarily by moral
forces, and by material forces only as they
are subordinated to these moral forces. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>believe that material wealth is an exceedingly
valuable servant, and a particularly abhorrent
master, in our National life. I think
one end of government should be to achieve
prosperity; but it should follow this end
chiefly to serve an even higher and more
important end—that of promoting the character
and welfare of the average man. In
the long run, and inevitably, the actual control
of the government will be determined
by the chief end which the government subserves.
If the end and aim of government
action is merely to accumulate general material
prosperity, treating such prosperity as
an end in itself and not as a means, then it is
inevitable that material wealth and the
masters of that wealth will dominate and control
the course of national action. If, on the
other hand, the achievement of material
wealth is treated, not as an end of government,
but as a thing of great value, it is true—so
valuable as to be indispensable—but of
value only in connection with the achievement
of other ends, then we are free to seek
through our government, and through the
supervision of our individual activities, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>realization of a true democracy. Then we
are free to seek not only the heaping up of
material wealth, but a wise and generous distribution
of such wealth so as to diminish
grinding poverty, and, so far as may be, to
equalize social and economic no less than
political opportunity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people as a whole can be benefited
morally and materially by a system which
shall permit of ample reward for exceptional
efficiency, but which shall nevertheless secure
to the average man who does his work faithfully
and well, the reward to which he is entitled.
Remember that I speak only of the
man who does his work faithfully and well.
The man who shirks his work, who is lazy or
vicious, or even merely incompetent, deserves
scant consideration; we may be sorry for his
family, but it is folly to waste sympathy on
the man himself; and it is also folly for sentimentalists
to try to shift the burden of blame
from such a man himself to “society;” and it
is an outrage to give him the reward given to
his hard-working, upright, and efficient
brother. Still less should we waste sympathy
on the criminal; there are altogether too many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>honest men who need it; and one chief point
in dealing with the criminal should be to
make him understand that he will be in personal
peril if he becomes a lawbreaker. I
realize entirely that in the last analysis, with
the nation as with the individual, it is private
character that counts for most. It is because
of this realization that I gladly lay myself
open to the charge that I preach too much,
and dwell too much upon moral commonplaces;
for though I believe with all my heart
in the nationalization of this Nation—in the
collective use on behalf of the American people
of the governmental powers which can be
derived only from the American people as a
whole—yet I believe even more in the practical
application by the individual of those
great fundamental moralities.</p>

<p class='c010'>A certain type of rather thinly intellectual
man sneers at these moralities as “commonplaces;”
and base and evil men, selfish and
shortsighted men, are immensely pleased to
see them denounced and derided. Yet surely
it is the duty of every public man to try to
make all of us keep in mind, and practice,
the moralities essential to the welfare of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>American people. It is of vital concern to
the American people that the men and women
of this great Nation should be good husbands
and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and
daughters; that we should be good neighbors,
one to another, in business and in social life;
that we should each do his or her primary
duty in the home without neglecting the duty
to the State; that we should dwell even more
on our duties than on our rights; that we
should work hard and faithfully; that we
should prize intelligence, but prize courage
and honesty and cleanliness even more. Inefficiency
is a curse; and no good intention
atones for weakness of will and flabbiness of
moral, mental, and physical fiber; yet it is
also true that no intellectual cleverness, no
ability to achieve material prosperity, can
atone for the lack of the great moral qualities
which are the surest foundation of national
might. In this great free democracy it behooves
all the people so to bear themselves
that, not with their lips only but in their lives,
they shall show their fealty to the great truth
pronounced of old—the truth that Righteousness
exalteth a nation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Pioneer Spirit and American Problems</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>For a number of years I have believed
and urged the principles I set forth
in the following article. Their presentation
here is in substance what I said in
three recent speeches at Cheyenne, Denver,
and Omaha.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men who have made this great republic
what it is, and especially the men who have
turned it into a continental commonwealth,
have possessed in the highest degree the great
virile virtues of strength, courage, energy,
and undaunted and unwavering resolution.
Their typical leaders—of whom Abraham
Lincoln, though the most exceptional, was
the most typical—have possessed keen intelligence,
and a character not merely strong but
lofty, a character exalted by the fact that
great power was accompanied by a high and
fine determination to use this great power for
the common good, for the advancement of
mankind. Such men were the builders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>New England. As the country grew, such
men were the pioneers that pushed the frontiers
of civilization westward. A hundred
years ago, when men spoke of the West, they
meant the country between the Alleghanies
and the Mississippi. Fifty years ago the
white man’s West took in Minnesota, Iowa,
and Kansas, and then skipped across to California
and Oregon. The country of the
great plains and the Rockies has grown up
within my own lifetime. I myself saw and
took part in the closing years of the pioneer
period, and it was my great privilege to work
side by side with the pioneers—the ranchmen,
the miners, the cow-punchers, the mule-skinners,
the bull-whackers—who actually
opened up the country. I now travel in every
comfort on railways across lands which, when
I first rode across them, were still the home
of the Indian and the buffalo; and I find cities
where one can obtain not merely comfort but
luxury, in the places where, thirty years ago,
there was not a building beyond a log hut or
a ’dobe house. The men who did this work
were engaged in the final stages of conquering
the continent; and it was their privilege to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>one of the great works of all time, to do their
part in the performance of an epic feat in the
history of the progress of mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pioneer days are over, save in a few
places; and the more complex life of to-day
calls for a greater variety of good qualities
than were needed on the frontier. There is
need at present to encourage the development
of new abilities which can be brought to high
perfection only by a kind of training useless
in pioneer times; but these new qualities can
only supplement, and never supplant, the old,
homely virtues; the need for the special and
distinctive pioneer virtues is as great as ever.
In other words, as our civilization grows
older and more complex, while it is true that
we need new forms of trained ability, and
need to develop men whose lives are devoted
wholly to the pursuit of special objects, it is
yet also true that we need a greater and not
a less development of the fundamental frontier
virtues.</p>

<p class='c010'>These qualities, derived from the pioneers,
were not confined to the pioneers. They are
shown in the deeds of the Nation; and especially
in the two great feats which during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>past decade have made the deepest impression
abroad—the cruise of the battle fleet around
the world, and the digging of the Panama
Canal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, there is no use of a nation claiming
to be a great nation, unless it is prepared to
play a great part. A nation such as ours
cannot possibly play a great part in international
affairs, cannot expect to be treated as
of weight in either the Atlantic or the Pacific,
or to have its voice as to the Monroe Doctrine
or the management of the Panama Canal
heeded, unless it has a strong and thoroughly
efficient navy. So far from this increase in
naval strength representing on our part either
a menace of aggression to weaker nations or
a menace of war to stronger nations, it has
told most powerfully for peace. No nation
regarded the cruise as fraught with any menace
of hostility to itself; and yet every nation
accepted it as a proof that we were not only
desirous ourselves to keep the peace, but able
to prevent the peace being broken at our expense.
No cruise in any way approaching
it has ever been made by any fleet of any other
Power; and the best naval opinion abroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>had been that no such feat was possible; that
is, that no such cruise as that we actually made
could be undertaken by a fleet of such size
without innumerable breakdowns and accidents.
The success of the cruise, performed
as it was without a single accident, immeasurably
raised the prestige, not only of our fleet,
but of our Nation; and was a distinct help to
the cause of international peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>As regards the Panama Canal, I really
think that outside nations have a juster idea
than our own people of the magnitude and
success of the work. Six years ago last
spring the American Government took possession
of the Isthmus. The first two years
were devoted to the sanitation of the Isthmus,
to assembling the plant and working force,
and providing quarters, food, and water supplies.
In all these points the success was
extraordinary. From one of the plague-spots
of the globe, one of the most unhealthy
regions in the entire world, the Isthmus has
been turned into a singularly healthy place of
abode. Active excavation on a large scale
did not begin until January, 1907. Three
years and a half have gone by since then, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>three-fifths of the total excavation has already
been accomplished. In 1908 and 1909 the
monthly average of rock and earth removed
was three million cubic yards, notwithstanding
the fact that nine months of each year constituted
a season of very heavy rainfall; but
it is impossible to maintain such a ratio as the
depth increases. Still, it is certain that such
a rate can be maintained as will enable the
workers to finish the excavation considerably
in advance of the date fixed for opening the
Canal—January 1, 1915. Indeed, I shall
be surprised if the Canal cannot be opened
six months or even a year in advance of the
time set. The work has two great features:
The Culebra Cut, which I have been considering,
and the great dam at Gatun. The
construction of the dam has advanced sufficiently
to convince the engineers in charge of
the work of its absolute stability and imperviousness.
The engineer in charge has announced
that all the concrete in all the locks
will be in place two years hence.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a stupendous record of achievement.
As a people we are rather fond of criticising
ourselves, and sometimes with very great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>justice; but even the most pessimistic critic
should sometimes think of what is to our
credit. Among our assets of the past ten
years will be placed the extraordinary ability,
integrity, and success with which we have
handled all the problems inherited as the
result of the Spanish War; the way we have
handled ourselves in the Philippines, in Cuba,
in Porto Rico, in San Domingo, and in
Panama. The cruise of the battle fleet
around the world was a striking proof that
we had made good with the navy; and what
we have done at Panama represents the accomplishment
of one of the great feats of
the ages. It is a feat which reflects the
highest honor upon our country; and our
gratitude is due to every man who has taken
an honorable part in any capacity in bringing
it about.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same qualities that have enabled
Americans to conquer the wilderness, and to
attempt tasks like the building of the Panama
Canal and the sending of the battle fleet
around the world, need to be applied now to
our future problems; and these qualities,
which include the power of self-government,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>together with the power of joining with
others for mutual help, and, what is especially
important, the feeling of comradeship, need
to be applied in particular to that foremost
of National problems, the problem of the
preservation of our National resources.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question has two sides. In the first
place, the actual destruction, or, if this is not
possible, at any rate the needless waste, of
the natural resources must be stopped. In
the second place, so far as possible, these
resources must be kept for the use of the
whole people, and not handed over for exploitation
to single individuals or groups of
individuals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first point I shall not here discuss at
length. It is rapidly becoming a well-settled
policy of this people that we of the present
generation hold the land in part as trustees
for the next generation, and not exclusively
for our own selfish enjoyment. Just as the
farmer is a good citizen if he leaves his
farm improved and not impaired to his children,
and a bad citizen if he cares nothing
for his children and skins the land and
destroys its value in his own selfish interest;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>so the Nation behaves well if it treats the soil
and the water and the forests as assets which
it must turn over to the next generation increased
and not impaired in value, and
behaves badly if it leaves the land poorer to
those who come after us. No farm should
be so used that the soil is permitted to depreciate
in value; no forest so used as permanently
to impair its productivity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second part of the question relates to
preserving and using our natural resources
in the interest of the public as a whole. We
do not intend to discourage individual excellence
by improperly diminishing the reward
for that individual excellence; on the contrary,
our desire is to see that the fullest reward is
given to the men of exceptional abilities, up
to the point when the abilities are used to the
detriment of the people as a whole. We
favor the sheep man who feeds his sheep on
his own range in such manner that the range
increases instead of diminishes in value; and
we are against the big man who does not live
in the country at all, but who sends migratory
bands of sheep with a few hired shepherds to
wander over it, destroying pasturage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>forests, and seriously impairing the value of
the country for actual settlers. We are for
the liberty of the individual up to, but not
beyond, the point where it becomes inconsistent
with the welfare of the community as a
whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, to preserve the general welfare, to
see to it that the rights of the public are protected,
and the liberty of the individual
secured and encouraged as long as consistent
with this welfare, and curbed when it becomes
inconsistent therewith, it is necessary to invoke
the aid of the Government. There are
points in which this governmental aid can best
be rendered by the States; that is, where the
exercise of States’ rights helps to secure popular
rights, and as to these I believe in States’
rights. But there are large classes of cases
where only the authority of the National
Government will secure the rights of the people,
and where this is the case I am a convinced
and a thoroughgoing believer in the
rights of the National Government. Big
business, for instance, is no longer an affair
of any one State; big business has become
nationalized; and the only effective way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>controlling and directing it, and preventing
abuses in connection with it, is by having the
people nationalize this control in order to
prevent their being exploited by the individuals
who have nationalized the business.
All commerce on a scale sufficiently large to
warrant any control over it by Government
is nowadays inter-State or foreign commerce;
and until this fact is heartily acknowledged,
in particular by both courts and legislative
bodies, National and State alike, the interest
of the people will suffer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take the question of the control of the
water power sites. The enormous importance
of water power sites to the future industrial
development of this country has only
been realized within a very few years. Unfortunately,
the realization has come too late
as regards many of the power sites, but many
yet remain with which our hands are free to
deal. We should make it our duty to see that
hereafter the power sites are kept under the
control of the general Government for the
use of the people as a whole. The fee
should remain with the people as a whole,
while the use is leased on terms which will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>secure an ample reward to the lessees, which
will encourage the development and use of
the water power, but which will not create a
permanent monopoly or permit the development
to be anti-social, to be in any respect
hostile to the public good.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this country, nowadays, capital has a
National and not a State use. The great
corporations which are managed and largely
owned in the older States are those which are
most in evidence in developing and using the
mines and water powers and forests of the
new Territories and new States, from Alaska
to Arizona. I have been genuinely amused
during the past two months at having arguments
presented to me on behalf of certain
rich men from New York and Ohio, for instance,
as to why Colorado and other Rocky
Mountain States should manage their own
water power sites. Now I am sure that those
men, according to their lights, are good
citizens; but, naturally enough, their special
interest obscures their sense of the public
need; and as their object is to escape efficient
control, they clamor to be put under the State
instead of under the Nation. If we are foolish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>enough to grant their requests, we shall
have ourselves to blame when we wake up to
find that we have permitted another privilege
to intrench itself, and another portion of what
should be kept for the public good to be
turned over to individuals for purposes of
private enrichment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our people have for many years proceeded
upon the assumption that the Nation controls
the public land. The coal should be kept for
the people, and those who mine it should pay
part of the profit back to the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>Remember also that many of the men who
protest loudly against effective National
action would be the first to turn round and
protest against the State action if such action
in its turn became effective, and would then
unhesitatingly invoke the law to show that
the State had no Constitutional power to act.
I am a strong believer in efficient National
action; and if there is one thing which I abhor
more than another, it is the creation by legislative,
by executive, or by judicial action of
a neutral ground in which neither the State
nor the Nation has power, and which can
serve as a place of refuge for the lawless man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and especially for the lawless man of great
wealth, who can hire the best legal counsel to
advise him how to keep his abiding-place
equally distant from the uncertain frontier of
both State and National power.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me illustrate what I mean by a reference
to two concrete cases. The first is the
decision of the United States Supreme Court
in the Knight Sugar Trust case. This was
really a decision rendering it exceedingly
difficult for the people to devise any method
of controlling and regulating the business use
of great capital in inter-State commerce. It
was a decision nominally against National
rights, but really against popular rights,
against the democratic principle of government
by the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second case is the so-called New York
Bake-Shop case. In New York City, as in
most large cities, the baking business is likely
to be carried on under unhygienic conditions,
conditions which tell against the welfare of
the workers, and therefore against the welfare
of the general public. The New York Legislature
passed, and the New York Governor
signed, a bill remedying these improper conditions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>New York State was the only body
that could deal with them; the Nation had no
power whatever in the matter. Acting on
information which to them seemed ample and
sufficient; acting in the interest of the public
and in accordance with the demand of the
public, the only governmental authority having
affirmative power in the matter, the Governor
and the Legislature of New York, took
the action which they deemed necessary, after
what inquiry and study were needed to satisfy
them as to the conditions and as to the remedy.
The Governor and the Legislature alone had
the power to remedy the abuse. But the
Supreme Court of the United States possessed,
and unfortunately exercised, the negative
power of not permitting the abuse to be remedied.
By a five to four vote they declared
the action of the State of New York unconstitutional.
They were, of course, themselves
powerless to make the remotest attempt to
provide a remedy for the wrong which undoubtedly
existed, and their refusal to permit
action by the State did not confer any power
upon the Nation to act. In effect, it reduced
to impotence the only body which did have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>power, so that in this case the decision,
although nominally against State rights, was
really against popular rights, against the
democratic principle of government by the
people under the forms of law.</p>

<p class='c010'>If such decisions as these two indicated the
Court’s permanent attitude, there would be
real and grave cause of alarm; for such decisions,
if consistently followed up, would upset
our whole system of popular Government. I
am, however, convinced, both from the inconsistency
of these decisions with the tenor of
other decisions, and furthermore from the
very fact that they are in such flagrant and
direct contradiction to the spirit and needs of
the time, that sooner or later they will be
explicitly or implicitly reversed. I mention
them merely to illustrate the need of having
a truly National system of government under
which the people can deal effectively with all
problems, meeting those that affect the people
as a whole by affirmative Federal action,
and those that merely affect the people of one
locality by affirmative State action.</p>

<p class='c010'>In dealing with future problems like this
one of Conservation, we need to keep in mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the lesson taught by the American pioneer.
It is a lesson that is to be found in the fact
that the pioneer is so good an American. He
is an American, first and foremost. The
man of the West throughout the successive
stages of Western growth has always been
one of the two or three most typical figures,
indeed I am tempted to say the most typical
figure, in American life; and no man can really
understand our country, and appreciate what
it really is and what it promises, unless he has
the fullest and closest sympathy with the
ideals and aspirations of the West.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great lesson that all of us need to learn
and to keep is the lesson that it is unimportant
whether a man lives North or South, East or
West, provided that he is genuinely and in
good faith an American; that he feels every
part of the United States as his own, and that
he is honestly desirous to uphold the interests
of all other Americans in whatever sections
of the country they may dwell.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Tariff: A Moral Issue</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Whenever men just like ourselves—probably
not much better,
and certainly no worse—continually
fail to give us the results we have a right
to expect from their efforts, we may just as
well make up our minds that the fault lies,
not in their personality, but in the conditions
under which they work, and profit comes, not
from denouncing them, but in seeing that the
conditions are changed. This is especially
true of tariff-making. It has been conclusively
shown, by experiments repeated again
and again, that the methods of tariff-making
by Congress, which have now obtained for
so many years, cannot, from the very nature
of the case, bring really satisfactory results.
I think that the present tariff is better than
the last, and considerably better than the one
before the last; but it has certainly failed to
give general satisfaction. I believe this
country is fully committed to the principle of
protection; but it is to protection as a principle;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to protection primarily in the interest of
the standard of living of the American workingman.
I believe that when protection becomes,
not a principle, but a privilege and a
preference—or, rather, a jumble of privileges
and preferences—then the American people
disapprove of it. Now, to correct the trouble,
it is necessary, in the first place, to get in mind
clearly what we want, and, in the next place,
to get in mind clearly the method by which
we hope to obtain what we want. What we
want is a square deal in the tariff as in everything
else; a square deal for the wage-earner;
a square deal for the employer; and a square
deal for the general public. To obtain it
we must have a thoroughly efficient and well-equipped
tariff commission.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tariff ought to be a material issue and
not a moral issue; but if instead of a square
deal we get a crooked deal, then it becomes
very emphatically a moral issue. What we
desire in a tariff is such measure of protection
as will equalize the cost of production
here and abroad; and as the cost of production
is mainly labor cost, this means primarily
a tariff sufficient to make up for the difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>in labor cost here and abroad. The American
public wants the American laboring man
put on an equality with other citizens, so that
he shall have the ability to achieve the American
standard of living and the capacity to
enjoy it; and to do this we must see that his
wages are not lowered by improper competition
with inferior wage-workers abroad—with
wage-workers who are paid poorly and
who live as no Americans are willing to live.
But the American public does not wish to see
the tariff so arranged as to benefit primarily
a few wealthy men.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a means toward the attainment of its
end in view we have as yet devised nothing
in any way as effective as a tariff commission.
There should be a commission of well-paid
experts; men who should not represent any
industry; who should be masters of their subjects;
of the very highest character; and who
should approach the matter with absolute disregard
of every outside consideration. These
men should take up in succession each subject
with which the tariff deals and investigate the
conditions of production here and abroad;
they should find out the facts and not merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>accept the statements of interested parties;
and they should report to Congress on each
subject as soon as that subject has been
covered. Then action can be taken at once
on the particular subject concerned, while the
commission immediately proceeds to investigate
another. By these means log-rolling
would be avoided and each subject treated on
its merits, while there would be no such shock
to general industry as is implied in the present
custom of making sweeping changes in the
whole tariff at once. Finally, it should be the
duty of some Governmental department or
bureau to investigate the conditions in the
various protected industries, and see that
the laborers really are getting the benefit of
the tariff supposed to be enacted in their
interest. Moreover, to insure good treatment
abroad we should keep the maximum
and minimum provision.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same principle of a first-class outside
commission should be applied to river and
harbor legislation. At present a river and
harbor bill, like a tariff bill, tends to be settled
by a squabble among a lot of big selfish interests
and little selfish interests, with scant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>regard to the one really vital interest, that of
the general public. In this matter the National
Legislature would do well to profit by
the example of Massachusetts. Formerly
Massachusetts dealt with its land and harbor
legislation just as at Washington tariff and
river and harbor laws have been dealt with;
and there was just the same pulling and hauling,
the same bargaining and log-rolling, the
same subordination of the general interest to
various special interests. Last year Governor
Draper took up the matter, and on his recommendation
the Legislature turned the whole
business over to a commission of experts; and
all trouble and scandal forthwith disappeared.
Incidentally, this seems to me to be a first-class
instance of progressive legislation.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
